### 3.7.5 Pseudo Code for AR Try-On Process

The following pseudo code describes the main AR try-on process:

```
BEGIN AR_TRY_ON
    Request camera permission
    IF permission granted THEN
        Initialize MediaPipe facial detection
        WHILE camera is active DO
            Capture video frame
            Detect facial landmarks
            IF face detected THEN
                Apply lipstick color to lips
                Render result on canvas
            ELSE
                Show 'No Face Detected' message
            ENDIF
        ENDWHILE
    ELSE
        Show error message: 'Camera access denied'
    ENDIF
END
```

## 3.8 Structured Analysis

This section presents the structured analysis approach using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to complement the Object-Oriented Analysis and Design methodology. DFDs provide a different perspective on system functionality by showing how data flows through the system processes.

### 3.8.1 Data Flow Diagrams

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are used in structured analysis to show how data flows through the system. These diagrams provide a functional view of the system processes and data stores.

## 3.9 Logical Design

A comprehensive logical representation that captures the essential structure, behavior, and functionality of the system was systematically developed. This section presents the system architecture, control flow and process design, and design considerations for non-functional requirements to ensure robust system design.

### 3.9.1 System Architecture

The system employs a Layered Architecture with microservices principles, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. The architecture consists of four main layers:

#### 3.9.1.1 Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer handles user interface and interaction:

- **Next.js React Components**: Modular, reusable UI components
- **AR Canvas**: Real-time video rendering and facial overlay
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for cross-platform compatibility
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state management

#### 3.9.1.2 Business Logic Layer

The Business Logic Layer contains core application logic:

- **Next.js API Routes**: RESTful API endpoints for data operations
- **AR Processing**: MediaPipe integration for facial landmark detection
- **E-commerce Services**: Shopping cart and order management logic
- **Authentication Logic**: User session and permission management

#### 3.9.1.3 Data Access Layer

The Data Access Layer manages data persistence and retrieval:

- **Firebase SDK**: Client-side database operations
- **Firebase Admin**: Server-side data management
- **Cloud Storage**: Image and asset storage management
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and data integrity checks

#### 3.9.1.4 External Services Layer

The External Services Layer integrates third-party services:

- **MediaPipe**: Facial recognition and landmark detection
- **Paystack**: Payment processing and transaction management
- **Google OAuth**: User authentication and authorization
- **Vercel**: Application deployment and hosting

### 3.9.2 Control Flow and Process Design

The control flow and sequencing of activities within the system were defined to specify the processes, tasks, and their relationships. The main application flow includes three primary processes. The User Authentication Flow involves user clicking login, system redirecting to Google OAuth, user authenticating, system receiving callback, Firebase creating/updating user record, session creation, and user redirection to dashboard. The AR Try-On Flow involves user navigating to virtual try-on page, system requesting camera permissions, MediaPipe initializing facial landmark detection, real-time video processing beginning, system detecting facial landmarks (478 points), lipstick color application to detected lip contours, result rendering on canvas with realistic blending, and user adjustment capabilities for colors and finishes in real-time. The E-commerce Flow involves user browsing product catalog, adding products to shopping cart, proceeding to checkout, system validating cart and calculating totals, user entering delivery information, system redirecting to Paystack payment gateway, payment processing and confirmation, order creation in database, and user receiving confirmation and tracking information.

### 3.9.3 Design for Non-Functional Requirements

Security strategies were defined and integrated into the system design. The Security Strategy includes Google OAuth 2.0 with secure token management and JWT validation, Firebase security rules and data encryption, PCI-compliant Paystack integration, and comprehensive input validation for all user inputs and API requests. The Error Handling Strategy includes graceful degradation for AR functionality, clear error messages and loading states, comprehensive error logging with Firebase Analytics, and automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations. The Performance Optimization strategy includes planned code splitting with dynamic imports and lazy loading, Next.js automatic image optimization, browser and CDN caching strategies, and on-demand component loading for faster initial load.

## 3.10 Physical Design

### 3.10.1 Database Design

#### 3.10.1.1 Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER)

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) represents the conceptual data model for the AR Lipstick Try-On system. The EER diagram shows entities, their attributes, and relationships between entities.

![EER Diagram](Images/chapter3/eer_diagram.png)

**Figure 15**  
_Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER)_

#### 3.10.1.2 EER to Relational Schema Reduction

The EER diagram is reduced to relational schema using the following reduction process:

**Step 1: Entity Type Reduction**

- Each entity type becomes a relation
- Entity attributes become relation attributes
- Primary key is identified for each entity

**Step 2: Relationship Reduction**

- One-to-many relationships: Foreign key added to "many" side
- Many-to-many relationships: Junction table created
- One-to-one relationships: Foreign key added to either side

**Step 3: Attribute Reduction**

- Composite attributes: Flattened into simple attributes
- Multi-valued attributes: Separate relation created
- Derived attributes: Computed at application level

**Step 4: Inheritance Reduction**

- Single table inheritance: All subtypes in one table with type discriminator
- Class table inheritance: Separate tables for each subtype
- Concrete table inheritance: Separate tables for each concrete subtype

#### 3.10.1.3 Normalization Process

The relational schema undergoes normalization to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity:

**First Normal Form (1NF)**

- All attributes contain atomic values
- No repeating groups or arrays
- Primary key identified for each relation

**Second Normal Form (2NF)**

- Relation is in 1NF
- All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key
- Partial dependencies eliminated

**Third Normal Form (3NF)**

- Relation is in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies exist
- All non-key attributes depend only on the primary key

**Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

- Every determinant is a candidate key
- Eliminates all functional dependencies that are not superkeys
